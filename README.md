Hello Everyone!

Vaishnavi Reddy here. I have built a mini clone of the popular educational site Coursera. This project begins with index.html, which redirects to either the login.html page or the signup.html page, depending on your requirement.


So if you'd like to view my project either you can download it or just click here (https://fanciful-valkyrie-377a3d.netlify.app/) to visit the website
At any point, if you want to return to the home page, you can click on the Coursera logo.

Thank you for exploring this project!
